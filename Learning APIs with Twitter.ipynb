    "## <center>Learning to use APIs, starting with Twitter</center>##\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of data science, an API (_application programming interface_), is a means of connecting to a database maintained by another party. That definition may sound simultaneously too simple and/or too abstract to mean anything so let's use Facebook as an example to explain it.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "If you're logged into your account via the Facebook app or website, any data you create or consume will be routed through your connection to the company's servers and into or out of their oceans of data. Many would love to have be able to glimpse at the data flowing over that connection, but Facebook is making billions off of those data and doesn't want to share it all, especially because users wouldn't like that. But Facebook also knows that third-party apps add a lot of value to the platform, so they need a way to allow third parties to create new data and see some of a user's existing data on behalf of the user. The Facebook API is the means by which they do that. An API defines protocols and methods for using pretty much any machine with an internet connection to connect to and make requests of a webserver and the data storage system behind it.   \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The term API actually covers more than what I described above. For example, if you've used `matplotlib` for data visualization in Python, you shouldn't be using the classes defined by the main package directly. You should be using `pyplot`--via a statement like `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`--, which is an API whose functions manages a lot of the hardest work for you. But in the world of data science/big data, the term generally refers to a means to connect to a server and database.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "As data hungry scientists, we might wish every data storage system had an API we could plug into, but (un?)-fortunately they don't. In fact, is more likely that they don't have an API than they do. Places like the US Census Bureau have APIs as a public service, but for a company to invest in making and maintaning an API, and risk losing user's trust by making personal information available, the company needs to see a significant financial upside to it. Most companies don't, and the APIs that do exist usually don't make all data available and might in fact be trending toward making less available. This has happened with the Facebook API and for good reason. A lot of personal information was made available to third-party apps with user permissions it's clear that users aren't comfortable with that (see Cambridge Analytica).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "## But then there was Twitter ##\n",
    "There is a technical reason why you've seen and heard about so much research based on Twitter data. Because the platform aims to be a place for public discussion and dissemination of information, Twitter makes its easy to algorithmically collect its data, including metadata and other things not rendered in feeds. The comparative ease with which anyone can get data make Twitter a go-to source for trying to answer some types of questions. The jury is still out on how generalizable the finding are, but President Trump's affinity for the platform has at least kept it relevant and interesting.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "To introduce you to APIs, we are doing to explore Twitter data and produce some descriptive findings. To make this notebook work, I've created a module that can help gather, archive, search for and display tweets interactively. When there is a clear relationship between what the module's functions are doing and what the actual Twitter API is doing, I've included the actual API call (what the command looks like). \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "I've chosen this approach over dealing directly with the Twitter API because (1) the raw data you get back from the API can be overwhelming and possibly discouraging; (2) I'm trying to give you a general feel for how APIs work, not bore you with the details of the Twitter API; and (3) it's a lot of fun to play around with Twitter data and I want to make sure we get to that, which we couldn't do without sidelining some of the specific details.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "### A couple more important details about using the Twitter API ###\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "First, Twitter does not provide access to all tweets with the standard connection, but instead allows users to find particular tweets or sample from realtime or historical data. The sample is random in principle, but the sampling schemes aren't public and the highly dynamic nature of the platform means there are probably a number of schemes that could be defended as being properly random. This shouldn't amount to much, but it's worth knowing.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The API Twitter provides uses the [REST protocol](https://spring.io/understanding/REST), which means if you know the right way to format the requests you can send them and get responses using just your web browser. It turns out this is clunky and inconvenient so people create libraries mapping commands written in your favorite programming language to the proper REST requests. We'll be making use of one of the Python packages, `twitter` below so you need to have it on your computer. We'll also need the package/library `whoosh` for creating a searchable index. Use the Anaconda Navigator or the command line to install the packages. The Navigator tabs for environments you can search for the packages by name and import them. Use either `easy_install twitter` or `pip install twitter` for command line installation.\n",

    "### Topic 1: the JSON format \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Before we get to the API, we need to seque to the data format that the Twitter API, and many others, uses to give data to us. A common format for API data is the *JSON* (JavaScript Object Notation) format. A *JSON* formatted file is human-readable and ends with *.json*. At this point, the format's only meaningful connection to its namesake JavaScript is that it is built around the concept of *objects*, which is at the core of the object-oriented programming paradigm that Java helped popularized. This matters to us only in that thinking in terms of objects is helpful for a lot of big data research.\n",

    "As you can see, whatever a Tweet is, it is complex thing. (Can you even find the text of the tweet that actually shows up on your tweetbox?) What is clear is it exists in a set of relationships. And if there are relationships, there must be things being related. So let's just call those things *objects* to be stay generic as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OO), objects are a collection of *fields* (or attributes) and *methods*, procedures to modify the fields. The essense of an *OO* program is the design of the objects and manipulation of them via methods. (OK, and a bunch of stuff we won't get into.) To do something with objects, we need to know a lot about them, but if we are just moving them around as we are when collecting data, we just need the names of the fields and their contents. So we need a file format that can keep track of attributes of objects.\n",

A row for each observation can work fine for keeping track of an observation and its attributes, but what if an attribute is a reference to something other than another observation of the same type? That is, to another type of object? There is a good chance we'll want to know more about those other objects so we want its attributes too. Unfortunately, a spreadsheet isn't very convenient for transporting that type of information. The JSON format can help us address this problem and that's why lots of data rich APIs use them.\n",

This process is slow (in the world of computers, that is) so if you are looking at posts from a bunch a people, it can take a long time.

An important thing to note about these data is that Twitter limits the information to a random sampling of 100 of the retweets. So while the tweet might have 2000 retweets, you'll see at most 101 nodes in this network. For the purpose of this lab, you may consider this a representative sample and conduct your analyze using these data."
